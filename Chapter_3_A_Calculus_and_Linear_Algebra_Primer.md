# Chapter 3: A Calculus and Linear Algebra Primer

```{caution} This book was initially prepared on short notice and is an ongoing, ever-evolving project. Many of the ideas, simulations, and visualizations here are incomplete, and most are missing citations. If you feel that I have neglected to cite the proper sources, please do not be offended. It is more than likely that I am in the processes of adding the relevant citations.
