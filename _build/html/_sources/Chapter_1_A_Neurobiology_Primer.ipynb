The short answer is that we have no hope of doing so. The longer answer is that even though we cannot provide a comprehensive account of life and all its varied manifestations, This is, after all, a course on theoretical neurobiology, and to simply give a list of known facts about the living world would be antithetical to the aims and spirit of the course.\n",
